Plugin
- New death ban; two states, passive or aggressive
- Add a power system like factions has (to limit the power of /raze)
- Re-add raze, but limit it (as a counter for overextending claims, mostly)
- Change internal storage to use UUIDs not playernames
- Finish dividing the plugin up
- Alter /chunk to properly work with delays (eg make checks, wait x seconds, make checks again, do stuff)
- Revise/fix current ban voting system
- Random nation spawn for freelancers w/o bed and new players
- Set nation spawn for players in a nation without a bed
- Reorder all nation commands into one with subcommands (/nation or /na)
 (THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE /chunk COMMANDS.)

- Improve key forging's effectiveness (still super expensive, but not useless)
- Rewrite embassies to have multiple leaders in charge, as opposed to none
- Rewrite power transfer after a leader's death, to cover various other circumstances
- Add a golden hoe for a GUI
